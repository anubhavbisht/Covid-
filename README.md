Website for covid detection and improving efficiency

ABSTRACT:
Recently Corona Virus emerged as Global Pandemic and took up many lives and stopped the pace of the world for months. Using this COVID 19 Probability Estimator, a person can self test himself and know the probability of him or her being infected by corona virus. To test this a MACHINE LEARNING model is created with sample parameters. Whenever a person tests himself, his test results message would be sent to concerned authorities like hospitals or district administration. Based on the result, authority can take appropriate actions.

IDEA BEHIND PROJECT

•	Idea is to stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the cases quickly. 
•	Data can be collected on symptoms of COVID 19. 
•	A Machine Learning model is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the infection. 
•	Model is then used to find out whom to test for infection first. 
•	 Same model can be used to find potential candidates for conducting random tests. 
SOFTWARE USED:  
•	Python(Machine Learning Algorithm Random Forest Classifier)
•	Website Frontend -  HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT
•	Website Backend -  Flask and ML Model
•	For Data Processing – Excel Sheet
•	For messaging of test results to govt. authorities, Twilio API (Python) will be used.
